Go to [How to Grade in Learning Suite.md](/resources/How-to-Grade-in-Learning-Suite.md) to see how to get to the grader and begin grading. 

Note: "-3" means subtract three points.

# Lab 1:

```4) What is the relationship between the resistor value you use and how bright the LED shines? What could be the cause of this relationship?```

The greater the resistance, the lower the current because of Ohm’s Law V=IR
- -1.5 points if they don’t mention Ohm’s law, either the equation, description, or by name. Mentioning Ohm's law includes talking about how changing current impacting the LEDs brightness. 
- -3 points if it’s just wrong

```5) What resistor did you use in your circuit? (Units of Ω)```

```6) What voltage do you measure across your resistor using the multimeter? (Units of V)```

- -1.5 if their voltage doesn’t seem right.

```7) According to those measurements, what current is being supplied to the circuit by the Arduino? (Units of mA)```

Use V=IR to see if their math works. 
- -1.5 if the math is wrong
  
```8) Upload a photo of the soldered Arduino board.```

- Full points if they uploaded a picture and the board is soldered.
    - -4 points if it's an HEIC picutre. 

```9) Paste your Arduino code below:```
- 0 points if they didn't submit any code. Email or message them requesting it.
  - -5 points if they send the code. 
- Full points if it is the code that would blink a light like a heartbeat.
- Half points if it is the code that would blink a light steadily.
- None if obviously the code doesn’t work.

```10) Paste a link to your video below (make sure the settings are public, so anyone can see it):```
- 0 points if you can’t see the video. Add the comment:
  > Your video is not public. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link to the video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they resend the video.
- 0 points if you can't see their name on the breadboard. Add the comment:
  > Your video does not have a name on the breadboard. Please email me (insert TA email here) with a new link a new video and I will grade it. (With a -3 point deduction).
  - -3 points if they send a new video, although if the original video would have had a lower score then give them that score. 
##### Video Rubric:
This video should show that the LED is blinking, the name should be on the breadboard, and the wires (like the ground connection, etc.) and resistors must be cut.
- 0 points for no name on the breadboard (see above).
- -3 points for not cutting resistors or really sloppy wiring.
  - Warn them for uncut LEDs.
- -3 points if the LED doesn’t blink like a heartbeat.
- -3 points if no talking explanation of how it works.
- -3 points mentioned above for having to request permission for the video. 

```11) <ECEn 240 only>  Add your lab report here (PDF only).```
- For 301: Give them the same points here as you gave them for Question 10.
- For 240: Use the rubric on [Learning Suite](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/.YoSI/cid-d8RgIfkKFPjI/student/pages/page/id-vIiK) ([download](https://learningsuite.byu.edu/plugins/Upload/fileDownload.php?fileId=f7dfd05e-fpKi-a1kw-5SBC-52ec5754a070)) to assess the quality of the lab report. 
- - Note: Most 240 lab reports should get full points as long as they put in effort, it looks professional, and they included most of or all the diagrams. 
- -3 if not o-scope plot of the rise time (or isn’t actually measuring anything)
- -3 if no o-scope plot of the frequency (or isn’t actually measuring anything)
- -3 if their plots are not taken via usb
- -3 if they don’t mention how they changed the resistance to change the current
- -3 if no conclusion or introduction
- -3 if not professional (this has to be really bad to take this off)
- Give a warning if they didn’t submit as a pdf or if they submit a .heic picture.

```12) In what ways could this lab be improved? (extra credit)```

This usually grades automatically, but people often put “nothing” or something of the sort. Please check this and make sure it is right.  
- -1 point if they do not answer it with some real feedback.
